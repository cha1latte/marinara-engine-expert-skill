# Custom Tool + Webhook Recipe

Complete starter for building a custom tool that lets a character call an external service.

## 1. The Tool Definition (save in Marinara)

Go to **Agents Panel → Custom Tools → New**. Fill in:

```json
{
  "name": "example_lookup",
  "description": "Look up an item by ID from the backing service. Returns structured details. Use when the user asks about a specific item by name or ID.",
  "executionType": "webhook",
  "webhookUrl": "https://your-backend.example.com/marinara/lookup",
  "enabled": true,
  "parametersSchema": {
    "type": "object",
    "properties": {
      "id": {
        "type": "string",
        "description": "The unique identifier of the item (e.g. 'client-123', 'sku-A7', 'domain.com')"
      },
      "include_details": {
        "type": "boolean",
        "description": "If true, include the full detail record; if false, return summary only.",
        "default": false
      }
    },
    "required": ["id"]
  }
}
```

**Naming:** lowercase snake_case, specific verb-noun.
**Description:** 1-2 sentences. Say what it returns AND when to use it.
**Parameters:** required fields only in `required`. Use `enum` for bounded choices. Always include `description` on each property.

## 2. Teach the Character to Use It (in the card)

In the character's `description` or `system_prompt`, mention the tool and when to use it:

> "When the user asks about a specific item by name, call `example_lookup` with the item's ID before answering. Use the returned data to give an accurate response. If the tool returns an error, tell the user you couldn't find it and suggest they check the spelling."

This framing massively improves call quality. Models rarely figure out tool use from the parameters schema alone.

## 3. The Webhook Backend (any language/framework)

The engine POSTs JSON to your URL with shape:
```json
{
  "tool": "example_lookup",
  "arguments": { "id": "client-123", "include_details": true }
}
```

You return JSON. Keep it concise — it becomes tokens in the model's context.

### Express (Node.js) minimal example

```javascript
const express = require("express");
const app = express();
app.use(express.json());

app.post("/marinara/lookup", async (req, res) => {
  const { tool, arguments: args } = req.body;
  const { id, include_details } = args;

  try {
    const item = await db.items.findById(id);
    if (!item) {
      return res.json({ error: `No item found with id '${id}'` });
    }
    res.json({
      id: item.id,
      name: item.name,
      status: item.status,
      ...(include_details && { details: item.fullDetails })
    });
  } catch (err) {
    res.json({ error: `Lookup failed: ${err.message}` });
  }
});

app.listen(3100);
```

### FastAPI (Python) minimal example

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI, Request

app = FastAPI()

@app.post("/marinara/lookup")
async def lookup(req: Request):
    body = await req.json()
    args = body.get("arguments", {})
    item_id = args.get("id")
    include_details = args.get("include_details", False)

    item = await db.items.find_by_id(item_id)
    if not item:
        return {"error": f"No item found with id '{item_id}'"}

    result = {
        "id": item.id,
        "name": item.name,
        "status": item.status,
    }
    if include_details:
        result["details"] = item.full_details
    return result
```

### Cloudflare Worker example

```javascript
export default {
  async fetch(request) {
    const { tool, arguments: args } = await request.json();
    const { id } = args;

    const item = await env.DB.prepare("SELECT * FROM items WHERE id = ?")
      .bind(id)
      .first();

    if (!item) {
      return Response.json({ error: `No item found with id '${id}'` });
    }
    return Response.json(item);
  }
};
```

## 4. Response Design

**Do:**
- Return structured JSON objects.
- Include an `error` key when things go wrong — with a human-readable message the model can relay.
- Trim fields to what the model actually needs.
- Use consistent field names across tools.

**Don't:**
- Return huge blobs of HTML or raw text.
- Return stack traces or internal IDs the model shouldn't expose.
- Put API keys in the URL query string (they'll be stored plaintext in Marinara's DB).
- Take longer than 10 seconds — the engine times out.

## 5. Testing

1. Create the tool in Marinara with `executionType: "static"` and `staticResult: "{ \"test\": true }"`.
2. Chat with the character and ask a question that should trigger the tool. Verify the model calls it.
3. Switch to `webhook` and point at your backend (use `localhost:3100` or similar during dev — Marinara runs locally too, so loopback works).
4. Watch your backend logs. Iterate on the schema description until call quality is good.

## 6. Security Notes

- **Marinara is local-first.** Your webhook URL is stored in the user's local SQLite DB. Not exposed externally.
- **Don't trust tool arguments blindly.** The model can and will hallucinate values. Validate in your backend.
- **Auth:** if your backend is remote, add authentication. Options: shared secret header (you set it in Marinara? you can't — so hardcode in backend), IP allowlist, or proxy through a local tunnel like Tailscale.
- **CORS doesn't apply** — the Marinara server (not browser) makes the request. No preflight, no CORS headers needed.

## 7. Common Patterns

### Read-only lookup (most common)
`get_customer`, `get_product`, `get_patch_notes` — single-arg tool, returns structured record.

### List/search
`search_customers`, `list_products` — takes a query string, returns an array of summary records.

### Write action
`create_ticket`, `send_email` — takes full params, returns success/failure + ID. Be careful with destructive actions; consider requiring the model to confirm with the user first (framing in the card).

### State machine
`start_workflow`, `advance_workflow`, `complete_workflow` — multiple tools that share state managed server-side. Use a chat-scoped ID to track.

### Aggregation
`get_summary` — runs a complex query and returns a digest. Offload heavy work to the backend, let the model talk about the result.
